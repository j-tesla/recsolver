# recsolver
C++ program to solve second order recursion relations.


This program findd the solution of recurrence relations of the form
a(n) = r a(n−1) + s a(n−2) + t,
where r, s, t and the first two terms a(0) , a(1) of the sequence are supplied by the user as integer constants. We
assume that s != 0.

This is an assignment of the course *CS21001 Discrete Structures - Autumn 2020*.
